🚀 Sales Prediction Project

Welcome to the Sales Prediction project! This repository contains a machine learning solution for predicting sales using various data analysis and modeling techniques.

🌐 Overview

This project aims to forecast sales based on historical data, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions. By leveraging machine learning models, we provide accurate predictions that help optimize inventory, pricing strategies, and resource allocation.

📊 Key Features

💡 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for effective modeling.

🔦 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends and patterns using ⭐ matplotlib and seaborn.

🔬 Feature Engineering: Enhanced data with encoding and scaling techniques.

🚀 Machine Learning Models: Trained and evaluated models like:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting

🎯 Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model performance with R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

📄 Dataset

The dataset contains information on sales trends, including features like:

Product category

Sales region
